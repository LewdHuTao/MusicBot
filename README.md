## Work in Progress

This bot is currently in development. You can use slash commands at the moment, and we will soon add support for message commands.


### How to Run This Bot

You can run this bot using Docker or without Docker. For an easy setup, you can use the `make` command. If you don't have `make` installed on your machine, you can use `run.sh`.

2. **Run `make`**: Open your console and type `make`. A list of available commands will appear.
